      <h5><p><b>Process</b></p></h5>
      <h6><p>Base source for the study area of Digby was downloaded from the Nova Scotia Topographic Database(NSTDB) 1:10000 Enhanced Topographic
        Data Base. The key map source was a custom theme layer compliments of the Nova Scotia Geomatics Centre (NSGC) Service Nova Scotia and Municipal
        Relations. The map data of the study area was clipped and merged to the dimensions of the study area. Then the study area was symbolized using
        cartographic principles. For the annotation of the map, GeoNames from the province of Nova Scotia was used to label the features using the Esri
        Standard label engine and was later annotated and edited. Furthermore, forested polygon feature class was created using Nova Scotia Department
        of Natural Resources Forest inventory database.</p></h6>

      <h5><p><b>Process</b></p></h5>
      <h6><p>For this map, a map of boat facilities in Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada were mapped using open data from
      <a href="http://catalogue-hrm.opendata.arcgis.com" target="_blank">Halifax Open Data Portal</a>. The data was downloaded as a shapefile
      then it was converted to a GeoJSON file using QGIS. Using the Atom text editor, the Geojson file was converted to JavaScript file. Then
      the basis of the web map was made customizing the basic template provided by <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>.
      Markers, marker clusters, scale, mouse position control and legend were added to the map. Markers were created/edited using Adobe Illustrator
      and “if” statement was used to show different attributes on a map. As the original data regarding the attributes(Boat Dock, Boat Launch and
      Wharf) were strings, each form of boat facility was given a coded value to execute the “if” statement in JavaScript.
      Also in the process, a basemap with multiple basemap layers were created to toggle between different basemap layers. </p></h6>

        road that could be accessed from Delusion Road. A Polyline was placed so that the alignment could be created using the polyline. Labels were Created
        to annotate the road alignments. Upon finishing the labeling, a table was created to show radius, length and line/chord direction.</p></h6>

              Using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, data was  then processed to make pie charts and charts for the two small maps created for the thematic
              map poster project. Colours of each NHL teams were applied to the charts and was used to depict the dominance of teams in each provice area
              used for the map. Upon completing each small map, the maps were then edited for the final time on Adobe InDesign for print. Logos of NHL
              teams as well as text explaining the rich history of Canadian NHL teams was explained. </p></h6>

            <h5><p><b>Process</b></p></h5>
            <h6><p>Feature data was collected using GPS pseudo-ranging observations around  COGS property. Using Trimble’s GNSS Planning utility,
              satellite availability (cut off of 15°) and DOP positions were analyzed using Trimble’s GNSS Planning utility to search for the favorable
              data collection time. Data was then collected using Trimble Juno handheld unit with satellite-based augmentation(SBAS). Nova Scotia Monuments
              around the site was used to assess accuracy of the unit. Feature attribute was then collected using data dictionary created for the project.
              Utilizing Canadian Active Control System (CACS) data from Lawrencetown base station, the collected data was corrected using Trimble Pathfinder
              Office 5.9 software. The corrected data was then exported in Esri shape file in NAD83 CSRS/UTM Zone 20 projection. Upon manually editing the data
              to correct geometry, the collected GNSS data was augmented with Nova Scotia property Records Database in Amherst, N.S. An arial photograph was
              then used todigitize the features and made into a map using ArcMap 10.6 software. </p></h6>
